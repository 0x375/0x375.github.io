## Development instructions

In order to preview your changes before committing them you need to have
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) installed.  

With Ruby installed install you will need to install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
via `gem install jekyll` and then you are set.

To preview the website locally you can execute `jekyll serve` from inside the
repo's directory which will serve the website on `http://localhost:4000`.
