and exact time will be announced at a later date but should be expected around
the 29th of April.

The topic isn't really set in stone. Be it security, coding, hardware, devops
or knitting related. A presentation of a trendy vulnerability; A Bitcoin miner
written in brainfuck; Guiding military drones using your mother's hairdryer or
Using AWS to create a network of spam bots that spam each other.

**As long as revolves around tech and is interesting just go ahead and submit
it.**
