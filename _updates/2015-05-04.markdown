After quite some time of inactivity 0x375 is back for 0x09. The event's place
and exact time will be announced at a later date but should be expected within
May 2015.

We welcome quality submissions for presentations on the theme of 0x375;
The topic isn't really set in stone. Be it security, coding, hardware, devops
or knitting related. A presentation of a trendy vulnerability; a Bitcoin miner
written in brainfuck; guiding military drones using your mother's hairdryer or
using AWS to create a network of spam bots that spam each other.

**As long as revolves around tech and is interesting just go ahead and submit
it.**

It can be as hardcore as you'd like; We can handle it. You can check out the
previous <a href="/events" title="Events">events</a> to get an idea what we are
interested in.

Just pick your poison and send us a <a href="mailto:info@0x375.net">mail</a>.
