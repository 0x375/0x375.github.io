0x375 is organized by the community for the community - help us keep it cool and alive by submitting your work!  

We (try to) frequently meet and arrange free-form talks in the field of IT security, but we are also open to technical subjects from other IT fields as well.
For example, hardware hacks and phreaking tricks are also welcome.  

Want to present something?  
[Drop us a mail](mailto:info@0x375.net) and we will take care of the rest!
